# Merry-Poppin-Pills_BN
A neat little mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights
### Introduction
This mod adds several pills of varying uses. It is a simple mod, and the only real outlier is that the pills can only be purchased through cash in the Recipes menu. Thus, you'll have a reason now to actually accumulate cash. All pills cost $100.00. Every pill in this mod is canonically an invention by Willy Wonka, and is produced and sold by Wonka Industries, Inc.
### Pill Types
• Overdose Pills: If you want to gain stimulant overdose in an instant, this is the one for you! Hardly addictive at all, so it is great for nouveau riches.

• Radiant Pills: If you require an immense blast of radiation, this one is for you. No idea why anyone would need these. Perhaps try feeding them to fellow NPCs?

• Full-Course Meal Pills: Solve world hunger one pill at a time! A single full-course meal pill is enough to sustain you for a day! Maybe.

• Fake Full-Course Meal Pills: If you want to feel full but not actually eat anything, try this one on for size! Great for people ready to begin their fasting journey.

• Invisible Pills: Chew on an invisible pill and, voila, become invisible yourself for a full minute!

• Miracle Healing Pills: These are about as effective as a good bandage, but there is an insane upside! These can be used infinitely! Correct! Never before has such an advancement been made in medicine. It's the well-spring of life that never dries!

• Instant Restoration Pills: For those special moments when you need your flesh to regrow, now. No dilly-dallying, time's a wastin'!

• Boom Pill: This isn't a pill at all. Just a bomb shaped like one. Don't swallow.

• Greed Pill: One greed pill can give birth to two. Make of that what you will.

• Clarity Pill: See everything for sixty seconds. EVERYTHING.
